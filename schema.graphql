Represents a one-time purchase of app services or features by a merchant, tracking the transaction details and status throughout the billing lifecycle. This object captures essential information about non-recurring charges, including price and merchant acceptance status.

One-time purchases are particularly valuable for apps offering premium features, professional services, or digital products that don't require ongoing subscriptions. For instance, a photography app might sell premium filters as one-time purchases, while a marketing app could charge for individual campaign setups or advanced analytics reports.

Use the `AppPurchaseOneTime` object to:
- Track the status of individual feature purchases and service charges
- Track payment status for premium content or digital products
- Access purchase details to enable or disable features based on payment status

The purchase status indicates whether the charge is pending merchant approval, has been accepted and processed, or was declined. This status tracking is crucial for apps that need to conditionally enable features based on successful payment completion.

Purchase records include creation timestamps, pricing details, and test flags to distinguish between production charges and development testing. The test flag ensures that development and staging environments don't generate actual charges while maintaining realistic billing flow testing.

Tracks revenue that was captured outside of Shopify's billing system but needs to be attributed to the app for comprehensive revenue reporting and partner analytics. This object enables accurate revenue tracking when apps process payments through external systems while maintaining visibility into total app performance.

External revenue attribution is essential for apps that offer multiple payment channels or process certain transactions outside Shopify's billing infrastructure. For example, an enterprise app might process large custom contracts through external payment processors, or a marketplace app could handle direct merchant-to-merchant transactions that still generate app commissions.

Use the `AppRevenueAttributionRecord` object to:
- Report revenue from external payment processors and billing systems
- Track commission-based earnings from marketplace or referral activities
- Maintain comprehensive revenue analytics across multiple payment channels
- Ensure accurate partner revenue sharing and commission calculations
- Generate complete financial reports that include all app-generated revenue streams
- Support compliance requirements for external revenue documentation

Each attribution record includes the captured amount, external transaction timestamp, and idempotency keys to prevent duplicate reporting. The record type field categorizes different revenue streams, enabling detailed analytics and reporting segmentation.

Revenue attribution records are particularly important for apps participating in Shopify's partner program, as they ensure accurate revenue sharing calculations and comprehensive performance metrics. The captured timestamp reflects when the external payment was processed, not when the attribution record was created in Shopify.

For detailed revenue attribution values, see the [AppRevenueAttributionType enum](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/AppRevenueAttributionType).

A recurring billing agreement that associates an [`App`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/App) with a merchant's shop. Each subscription contains one or more [`AppSubscriptionLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppSubscriptionLineItem) objects that define the pricing structure.

Defines usage-based pricing terms for app subscriptions where merchants pay based on their actual consumption of app features or services. This pricing model provides flexibility for merchants who want to pay only for what they use rather than fixed monthly fees.

- See spending caps that protect merchants from unexpected charges

The balance and capped amount fields provide apps with data about current usage costs and remaining budget within the billing period, which apps can present to merchants to promote transparency in variable pricing.

A deployed cart transformation function that actively modifies how products appear and behave in customer carts. Cart transforms enable sophisticated merchandising strategies by programmatically merging, expanding, or updating cart line items based on custom business logic.

Use the `CartTransform` object to:
- Monitor active bundling and cart modification logic
- Track transform function deployment status and configuration
- Manage error handling behavior for cart processing failures
- Coordinate multiple transforms when running complex merchandising strategies
- Analyze transform performance and customer interaction patterns

Each cart transform links to a specific [Shopify Function](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/functions) that contains the actual cart modification logic. The `blockOnFailure` setting determines whether cart processing should halt when the transform encounters errors, or whether it should allow customers to proceed with unmodified carts. This flexibility ensures merchants can balance feature richness with checkout reliability.

Transform functions operate during cart updates, product additions, and checkout initiation, providing multiple touchpoints to enhance the shopping experience. They integrate seamlessly with existing cart APIs while extending functionality beyond standard product catalog capabilities.

The function ID connects to your deployed function code, while the configuration settings control how the transform behaves in different scenarios. Multiple transforms can work together, processing cart modifications in sequence to support complex merchandising workflows.

Creates a unified visual identity for your checkout that keeps customers engaged and reinforces your brand throughout the purchase process. This comprehensive branding system lets you control every visual aspect of checkout, from colors and fonts to layouts and imagery, so your checkout feels like a natural extension of your store.

For example, a luxury fashion retailer can configure their checkout with custom color palettes, premium typography, rounded corners for a softer feel, and branded imagery that matches their main website aesthetic.

Use the `Branding` object to:
- Configure comprehensive checkout visual identity
- Coordinate color schemes across all checkout elements
- Apply consistent typography and spacing standards
- Manage background imagery and layout customizations
- Control visibility of various checkout components

The branding configuration includes design system foundations like color roles, typography scales, and spacing units, plus specific customizations for sections, dividers, and interactive elements. This allows merchants to create cohesive checkout experiences that reinforce their brand identity while maintaining usability standards.

Different color schemes can be defined for various contexts, ensuring optimal contrast and accessibility across different checkout states and customer preferences.

The `Collection` object represents a group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
that merchants can organize to make their stores easier to browse and help customers find related products.
Collections serve as the primary way to categorize and display products across
[online stores](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store),
[sales channels](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels), and marketing campaigns.

There are two types of collections:

- **[Custom (manual) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection)**: You specify the products to include in a collection.
- **[Smart (automated) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)**: You define rules, and products matching those rules are automatically included in the collection.

The `Collection` object provides information to:

- Organize products by category, season, or promotion.
- Automate product grouping using rules (for example, by tag, type, or price).
- Configure product sorting and display order (for example, alphabetical, best-selling, price, or manual).
- Manage collection visibility and publication across sales channels.
- Add rich descriptions, images, and metadata to enhance discovery.

> Note:
> Collections are unpublished by default. To make them available to customers,
use the [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish)
mutation after creation.

Collections can be displayed in a store with Shopify's theme system through [Liquid templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/collection)
and can be customized with [template suffixes](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/alternate-templates)
for unique layouts. They also support advanced features like translated content, resource feedback,
and contextual publication for location-based catalogs.

Represents the publication status and settings for a collection across different sales channels. This tracks where collections are published, when they were published, and any channel-specific configuration.

For example, a "Holiday Gifts" collection might be published to the online store and Facebook Shop but not to the POS channel, with different publication dates for each channel based on marketing strategy.

Use `CollectionPublication` to:
- Track collection visibility across multiple sales channels
- Manage channel-specific collection settings and availability
- Monitor publication history and timing for collections
- Control where collections appear in customer-facing channels
- Implement channel-specific collection management workflows

Each publication record includes the channel information, publication status, and timing details. This enables merchants to control collection visibility strategically across their sales channels.

Collections can have different publication settings per channel, allowing for targeted marketing and inventory management. For instance, wholesale collections might only be published to B2B channels while retail collections appear in consumer-facing channels.

The publication system integrates with Shopify's broader channel management, ensuring collections appear consistently across the merchant's sales ecosystem while respecting channel-specific rules and permissions.

A carrier service (also known as a carrier calculated service or shipping service) provides real-time shipping rates to Shopify. Some common carrier services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term **carrier** is often used interchangeably with the terms **shipping company** and **rate provider**.

Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on what is in the customer's cart.

## Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource
To access the CarrierService resource, add the `write_shipping` permission to your app's requested scopes. For more information, see [API access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).

Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements:
* It's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.
* It's on the Shopify plan with yearly billing, or the carrier service feature has been added to the store for a monthly fee. For more information, contact [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/questions).
* It's a development store.

> Note:
> If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the requirements above.

## Providing shipping rates to Shopify
When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint rooted in the `callbackUrl` property where Shopify can retrieve applicable shipping rates. The callback URL should be a public endpoint that expects these requests from Shopify.

### Example shipping rate request sent to a carrier service

```json
{
  "rate": {
    "origin": {

      "postal_code": "K2P1L4",

           "metafields": [
               {
                   "key": "tracking_url",

               }
           ]
       }
   ]
}
```

The `address3`, `fax`, `address_type`, and `company_name` fields are returned by specific [ActiveShipping](https://github.com/Shopify/active_shipping) providers. For API-created carrier services, you should use only the following shipping address fields:
* `address1`
* `address2`
* `city`
* `zip`
* `province`
* `country`

Other values remain as `null` and are not sent to the callback URL.

### Response fields

When Shopify requests shipping rates using your callback URL, the response object `rates` must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields.  Required fields must be included in the response for the carrier service integration to work properly.

| Field                   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `service_name`          | Yes      | The name of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: `Expedited Mail`.                                                                                                                        |
| `description`           | Yes      | A description of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: `Includes tracking and insurance`.                                                                                                  |
| `service_code`          | Yes      | A unique code associated with the rate that must be consistent across requests. For example: `expedited_mail`.                                                                                               |
| `currency`              | Yes      | The currency of the shipping rate.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `total_price`           | Yes      | The total price expressed in subunits. If the currency doesn't use subunits, then the value must be multiplied by 100. For example: `"total_price": 500` for 5.00 CAD, `"total_price": 100000` for 1000 JPY. |
| `phone_required`        | No       | Whether the customer must provide a phone number at checkout.                                                                                                                                                |
| `min_delivery_date`     | No       | The earliest delivery date for the displayed rate.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `max_delivery_date`     | No       | The latest delivery date for the displayed rate to still be valid.                                                                                                                                           |
| `metafields`            | No       | An array of metafield objects to attach custom metadata to the shipping rate.                                                                                                                                |

### Special conditions

* To indicate that this carrier service cannot handle this shipping request, return an empty array and any successful (20x) HTTP code.
* To force backup rates instead, return a 40x or 50x HTTP code with any content. A good choice is the regular 404 Not Found code.
* Redirects (30x codes) will only be followed for the same domain as the original callback URL. Attempting to redirect to a different domain will trigger backup rates.
* There is no retry mechanism. The response must be successful on the first try, within the time budget listed below. Timeouts or errors will trigger backup rates.
* The `service_code` must be stable and consistent across requests for the same shipping option. It should not contain dynamic values like session IDs, timestamps, or request-specific identifiers. Use metafields for passing dynamic or session-specific data.

## Response Timeouts

The read timeout for rate requests are dynamic, based on the number of requests per minute (RPM). These limits are applied to each shop-app pair. The timeout values are as follows.

| RPM Range     | Timeout    |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Under 1500    | 10s        |
| 1500 to 3000  | 5s         |
| Over 3000     | 3s         |

> Note:
> These values are upper limits and should not be interpretted as a goal to develop towards. Shopify is constantly evaluating the performance of the platform and working towards improving resilience as well as app capabilities. As such, these numbers may be adjusted outside of our normal versioning timelines.

## Server-side caching of requests
Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of requests it makes. Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:
* variant IDs
* default shipping box weight and dimensions
* variant quantities
* carrier service ID
* origin address
* destination address
* item weights and signatures

If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original request, then new shipping rates are requested. The cache expires 15 minutes after rates are successfully returned. If an error occurs, then the cache expires after 30 seconds.

Defines customer targeting for discounts through specific individual customers. This object allows merchants to create exclusive discounts that are only available to explicitly selected customers.

For example, a VIP customer appreciation discount might target specific high-value customers by individually selecting them, or a beta program discount could be offered to selected early adopters.

Use `DiscountCustomers` to:
- Target specific individual customers for exclusive promotions
- Create personalized discount experiences for selected customers
- Offer special discounts to VIP or loyal customers
- Provide exclusive access to promotions for specific individuals

This targeting method requires you to add each customer who should be eligible for the discount. For broader targeting based on customer attributes or segments, use [`DiscountCustomerSegments`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCustomerSegments) instead.

The `DiscountNode` object enables you to manage [discounts](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts), which are applied at checkout or on a cart.


Discounts are a way for merchants to promote sales and special offers, or as customer loyalty rewards. Discounts can apply to [orders, products, or shipping](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/discounts#discount-classes), and can be either automatic or code-based. For example, you can offer customers a buy X get Y discount that's automatically applied when purchases meet specific criteria. Or, you can offer discounts where customers have to enter a code to redeem an amount off discount on products, variants, or collections in a store.

An order that a merchant creates on behalf of a customer. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:

- Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
- Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.
- Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't displayed in a shop's inventory.
- Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
- Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
- Take pre-orders.

For draft orders in multiple currencies `presentment_money` is the source of truth for what a customer is going to be charged and `shop_money` is an estimate of what the merchant might receive in their shop currency.

**Caution:** Only use this data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

## Retrieving fulfillment orders

### Fulfillment orders from an order

All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the
[Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)
connection.

[API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)
govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.
An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order
if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.

### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment

Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the
[assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/objects/queryroot#connection-assignedfulfillmentorders)
connection.
Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned fulfillment orders
should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a
[fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)
and it has yet to be responded to.

The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access
the assigned fulfillment orders.

### All fulfillment orders

Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the
[fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)
query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party fulfillment orders on the shop,
which are accessible to the app according to the
[fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.

## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order

### Fulfillment Order Creation

After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created
and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.

Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on
the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.

### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location

Fulfillment orders are completed by creating
[fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).
Fulfillments represents the work done.

For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset
has been provisioned.
For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once
the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.

On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,
a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating
to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.

[Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).

### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service

For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service,
a merchant or an Order Management App can
[send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)
to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items.
A fulfillment service has the option to
[accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)
or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)
this fulfillment request.

Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant
or order management app and instead a
[cancellation request must be submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)
to the fulfillment service.

Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,
then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the
[fulfillmentCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
mutation.
They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then
update the tracking information for fulfillments with the
[fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
mutation.

## API access scopes

Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:

* The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
  `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
  grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
* The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
  access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
  These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
  by fulfillment services.
* The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
  access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
  assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.

### Fulfillment service app access scopes

Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.
The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location
(or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).
The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations
or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.

### Order management app access scopes

**Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
`write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders
on behalf of a merchant.

If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service,
then the app should request all
access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.

## Notifications about fulfillment orders

Fulfillment services are required to
[register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)
a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified
whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.

Both merchants and apps can
[subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
to the
[fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)
to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.

A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders
on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items
and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations
include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new `FulfillmentService` on a store,
Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the fulfillment service.
To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to
[Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)
guide.

## Mutations

You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the
[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),
[fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),
and [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)
mutations.

## Hosted endpoints

Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that
Shopify can query on certain conditions.
These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callbackUrl` parameter
in the
[fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)
mutation.

- Shopify sends POST requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
  to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests.

  For more information, refer to
  [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders
  if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.

  For more information, refer to
  [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).

  Fulfillment services can also update tracking information using the
  [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate) mutation,
  rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
- Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve
  on hand inventory levels for the fulfillment service location if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.

  For more information, refer to
  [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#step-10-optional-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify).

To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints
in your development store.

## Resources and webhooks

There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work.
To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the
[FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),
[Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and
[Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) objects and related mutations.
To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,
besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,
fulfillment services can subscribe to the
[fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook)
webhooks.

The `MediaImage` object represents an image hosted on Shopify's
[content delivery network (CDN)](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/best-practices/performance/platform#shopify-cdn).
Shopify CDN is a content system that serves as the primary way to store,
manage, and deliver visual content for products, variants, and other resources across the Shopify platform.

The `MediaImage` object provides information to:

- Store and display product and variant images across online stores, admin interfaces, and mobile apps.
- Retrieve visual branding elements, including logos, banners, favicons, and background images in checkout flows.
- Retrieve signed URLs for secure, time-limited access to original image files.

Each `MediaImage` object provides both the processed image data (with automatic optimization and CDN delivery)
and access to the original source file. The image processing is handled asynchronously, so images
might not be immediately available after upload. The
[`status`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/mediaimage#field-MediaImage.fields.status)

Navigation menus that organize links into logical structures to guide customers through a store. Menus serve as the backbone of store navigation, making it easy for customers to find products, pages, and other content through organized hierarchical links.

For example, a merchant might create a main navigation menu with top-level categories like "Products," "About Us," and "Contact," where each category can contain nested menu items linking to specific collections, pages, or external resources.

Use the `Menu` object to:
- Build and customize store navigation structures
- Organize hierarchical menu systems with nested items
- Work with default menus that can't be deleted
- Access menu items for building navigation

Menus can be designated as default navigation elements (like main menu or footer), which can't be deleted and have restricted handle updates. The handle provides a unique identifier that themes can reference, while the items collection enables nested navigation structures.

Each menu contains menu items that can link to various resource types. This flexibility lets merchants create navigation experiences that guide customers through their store.

You can use the `MobilePlatformApplication` resource to enable
[shared web credentials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/shared_web_credentials) for Shopify iOS apps,
as well as to create [iOS universal link](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/)
or [Android app link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/) verification endpoints for merchant Shopify iOS or Android apps.
Shared web credentials let iOS users access a native app after logging into the respective website in Safari without re-entering
their username and password. If a user changes their credentials in the app, then those changes are reflected in Safari.
You must use a custom domain to integrate shared web credentials with Shopify. With each platform's link system,
users can tap a link to a shop's website and get seamlessly redirected to a merchant's installed app without going
through a browser or manually selecting an app.

For full configuration instructions on iOS shared web credentials,

The [`Collection.sortOrder`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection#field-collection-sortorder) must be `MANUAL`.
  
  How to use this mutation:
  - Provide only the products that actually moved in the `moves` list; do not send the entire product list. For example: to move the product at index 1 to index N, send a single move for that product with `newPosition: N`.
  - Each move is applied sequentially in the order provided.
  - `newPosition` is a zero-based index within the collection at the moment the move is applied (after any prior moves in the list).
  - Products not included in `moves` keep their relative order, aside from any displacement caused by the moves.
  - If `newPosition` is greater than or equal to the number of products, the product is placed at the end.
  
  Example:
  - Initial order: [A, B, C, D, E] (indices 0..4)
  - Moves (applied in order):
    - E -> newPosition: 1
    - C -> newPosition: 4
  - Result: [A, E, B, D, C]
  
  Displaced products will have their position altered in a consistent manner with no gaps.

  Updates a [collection](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection),

  in the [online store](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store) and
  other [sales channels](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels).
  
  Use the `collectionUpdate` mutation to programmatically modify collections in scenarios such as:
  
  - Updating collection details, like title, description, or image
  - Modifying SEO metadata for better search visibility
  - Changing which products are included (using rule updates for smart collections)
  - Publishing or unpublishing collections across different sales channels
  - Updating custom data using [metafields](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data/metafields)
  
  There are two types of collections with different update capabilities:
  
  - **[Custom (manual) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection)**: You can update collection properties, but rule sets can't be modified since products are manually selected.
  - **[Smart (automated) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)**: You can update both collection properties and the rules that automatically determine which products are included.
  When updating [rule sets](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CollectionRuleConditions) for smart collections, the operation might be processed asynchronously. In these cases, the mutation returns a [`job`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Job) object that you can use to track the progress of the update.
  
  To publish or unpublish collections to specific sales channels, use the dedicated
  [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish) and
  [`publishableUnpublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishableUnpublish) mutations.

  - **File content**: Replace image or generic file content while maintaining the same URL.
  - **Filename**: Modify file names (extension must match the original).
  - **Product references**: Add or remove associations between files and products. Removing file-product associations
  deletes the file from the product's media gallery and clears the image from any product variants that were using it.
  
  The mutation handles different file types with specific capabilities:
  
  - **Images**: Update preview images, original source, filename, and alt text.
  - **Generic files**: Update original source, filename, and alt text.
  - **Videos and 3D models**: Update alt text and product references.
  
  > Note:
  > Files must be in `ready` state before they can be updated. The mutation includes file locking to prevent
  > conflicts during updates. You can't simultaneously update both `originalSource` and `previewImageSource`.
  
  After updating files, you can use related mutations for additional file management:
  
  - [`fileCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fileCreate):
  Create new file assets from external URLs or staged uploads.
  - [`fileDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fileDelete):
  Remove files from your store when they are no longer needed.

  Cancels an order, with options for refunding, restocking inventory, and customer notification.
  
  > Caution:
  > Order cancellation is irreversible. An order that has been cancelled can't be restored to its original state.
  
  Use the `orderCancel` mutation to programmatically cancel orders in scenarios such as:
  
  - Customer-requested cancellations due to size, color, or other preference changes
  - Payment processing failures or declined transactions
  - Fraud detection and prevention
  - Insufficient inventory availability
  - Staff errors in order processing
  - Wholesale or B2B order management workflows
  
  The `orderCancel` mutation provides flexible refund options including refunding to original payment methods
  or issuing store credit. If a payment was only authorized (temporarily held) but not yet charged,
  that hold will be automatically released when the order is cancelled, even if you choose not to refund other payments.
  
  The mutation supports different cancellation reasons: customer requests, payment declines, fraud,
  inventory issues, staff errors, or other unspecified reasons. Each cancellation can include optional
  staff notes for internal documentation (notes aren't visible to customers).
  
  An order can only be cancelled if it meets the following criteria:
  
  - The order hasn't already been cancelled.
  - The order has no pending payment authorizations.
  - The order has no active returns in progress.
  - The order has no outstanding fulfillments that can't be cancelled.
  
  Orders might be assigned to locations that become
  [deactivated](https://help.shopify.com/manual/fulfillment/setup/locations-management#deactivate-and-reactivate-locations)
  after the order was created. When cancelling such orders, inventory behavior depends on payment status:
  
  - **Paid orders**: Cancellation will fail with an error if restocking is enabled, since inventory
  can't be returned to deactivated locations.
  - **Unpaid orders**: Cancellation succeeds but inventory is not restocked anywhere, even when the
  restock option is enabled. The committed inventory effectively becomes unavailable rather than being
  returned to stock at the deactivated location.
  
  After you cancel an order, you can still make limited updates to certain fields (like
  notes and tags) using the
  [`orderUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderUpdate).
  
  For partial refunds or more complex refund scenarios on active orders,
  such as refunding only specific line items while keeping the rest of the order fulfilled,
  consider using the [`refundCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/refundCreate)
  mutation instead of full order cancellation.

  Creates a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
  with attributes such as title, description, vendor, and media.
  
  The `productCreate` mutation helps you create many products at once, avoiding the tedious or time-consuming
  process of adding them one by one in the Shopify admin. Common examples include creating products for a
  new collection, launching a new product line, or adding seasonal products.
  
  You can define product
  [options](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) and
  [values](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue),
  allowing you to create products with different variations like sizes or colors. You can also associate media
  files to your products, including images and videos.
  
  The `productCreate` mutation only supports creating a product with its initial
  [product variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant).
  To create multiple product variants for a single product and manage prices, use the
  [`productVariantsBulkCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkCreate)
  mutation.
  
  > Note:
  > The `productCreate` mutation has a [throttle](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits#resource-based-rate-limits)
  > that takes effect when a store has 50,000 product variants. After this threshold is reached, no more than
  > 1,000 new product variants can be created per day.
  
  After you create a product, you can make subsequent edits to the product using one of the following mutations:
  
  - [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish):
  Used to publish the product and make it available to customers. The `productCreate` mutation creates products
  in an unpublished state by default, so you must perform a separate operation to publish the product.
  - [`productUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productUpdate):
  Used to update a single product, such as changing the product's title, description, vendor, or associated media.
  - [`productSet`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet):
  Used to perform multiple operations on products, such as creating or modifying product options and variants.

  Permanently deletes a product and all its associated data, including variants, media, publications, and inventory items.
  
  Use the `productDelete` mutation to programmatically remove products from your store when they need to be
  permanently deleted from your catalog, such as when removing discontinued items, cleaning up test data, or
  synchronizing with external inventory management systems.
  
  The `productDelete` mutation removes the product from all associated collections,
  and removes all associated data for the product, including:
  
  - All product variants and their inventory items
  - Product media (images, videos) that are not referenced by other products
  - [Product options](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) and [option values](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue)
  - Product publications across all sales channels
  - Product tags and metadata associations
  
  The `productDelete` mutation also has the following effects on existing orders and transactions:
  
  - **Draft orders**: Existing draft orders that reference this product will retain the product information as stored data, but the product reference will be removed. Draft orders can still be completed with the stored product details.
  - **Completed orders and refunds**: Previously completed orders that included this product aren't affected. The product information in completed orders is preserved for record-keeping, and existing refunds for this product remain valid and processable.
  
  > Caution:
  > Product deletion is irreversible. After a product is deleted, it can't be recovered. Consider archiving
  > or unpublishing products instead if you might need to restore them later.
  
  If you need to delete a large product, such as one that has many
  [variants](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  [locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location),

  [`ProductDeleteOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductDeleteOperation)

  If you need more granular control over product cleanup, consider using these alternative mutations:

  Update the product status to archived or unpublished instead of deleting.

  Delete specific variants while keeping the product.
  - [`productOptionsDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsDelete):

  Use the `productSet` mutation to sync information from an external data source into Shopify, manage large
  product catalogs, and perform batch updates. The mutation is helpful for bulk product management, including price
  adjustments, inventory updates, and product lifecycle management.
  
  The behavior of `productSet` depends on the type of field it's modifying:
  
  - **For list fields**: Creates new entries, updates existing entries, and deletes existing entries
  that aren't included in the mutation's input. Common examples of list fields include
  [`collections`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet#arguments-input.fields.collections),
  [`metafields`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet#arguments-input.fields.metafields),
  and [`variants`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet#arguments-input.fields.variants).
  
  - **For all other field types**: Updates only the included fields. Any omitted fields will remain unchanged.
  
  > Note:
  > By default, stores have a limit of 2048 product variants for each product.
  
  You can run `productSet` in one of the following modes:
  
  - **Synchronously**: Returns the updated product in the response.
  - **Asynchronously**: Returns a [`ProductSetOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductSetOperation) object.
  Use the [`productOperation`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productOperation) query to check the status of the operation and
  retrieve details of the updated product and its product variants.
  
  If you need to only manage product variants, then use one of the following mutations:

  Creates a refund for an order, allowing you to process returns and issue payments back to customers.
  
  Use the `refundCreate` mutation to programmatically process refunds in scenarios where you need to
  return money to customers, such as when handling returns, processing chargebacks, or correcting
  order errors.
  
  The `refundCreate` mutation supports various refund scenarios:
  
  - Refunding line items with optional restocking
  - Refunding shipping costs
  - Refunding duties and import taxes
  - Refunding additional fees
  - Processing refunds through different payment methods
  - Issuing store credit refunds (when enabled)
  
  You can create both full and partial refunds, and optionally allow over-refunding in specific
  cases.
  
  After creating a refund, you can track its status and details through the order's
  [`refunds`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#field-Order.fields.refunds)
  field. The refund is associated with the order and can be used for reporting and reconciliation purposes.

  and [refunding duties](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/view-and-refund-duties).
  
  > Note:
  > The refunding behavior of the `refundCreate` mutation is similar to the
  [`refundReturn`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnRefund)
  mutation. The key difference is that the `refundCreate` mutation lets you to specify restocking behavior
  for line items, whereas the `returnRefund` mutation focuses solely on handling the financial refund without
  any restocking input.
  
  > Caution:
  > As of 2026-01, this mutation supports an optional idempotency key using the `@idempotent` directive.
  > As of 2026-04, the idempotency key is required and must be provided using the `@idempotent` directive.

  The `ResourceFeedback` object lets your app report the status of shops and their resources. For example, if

  ## Sending feedback on a shop
  
  You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can have one of two states: `requires_action` or `success`. You need to send a `requires_action` feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.
  
  If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send feedback with a state of `requires_action` as merchants complete prior steps. And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a `success` feedback request.

  Creates staged upload targets for file uploads such as images, videos, and 3D models.
  
  Use the `stagedUploadsCreate` mutation instead of direct file creation mutations when:
  
  - **Uploading large files**: Files over a few MB benefit from staged uploads for better reliability
  - **Uploading media files**: Videos, 3D models, and high-resolution images
  - **Bulk importing**: CSV files, product catalogs, or other bulk data
  - **Using external file sources**: When files are stored remotely and need to be transferred to Shopify
  
  The `stagedUploadsCreate` mutation is the first step in Shopify's secure two-step upload process:
  
  **Step 1: Create staged upload targets** (this mutation)
  - Generate secure, temporary upload URLs for your files.
  - Receive authentication parameters for the upload.
  
  **Step 2: Upload files and create assets**
  - Upload your files directly to the provided URLs using the authentication parameters.
  - Use the returned `resourceUrl` as the `originalSource` in subsequent mutations like `fileCreate`.
  
  This approach provides better performance for large files, handles network interruptions gracefully,
  and ensures secure file transfers to Shopify's storage infrastructure.

The `Order` object represents a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a store. Use the `Order` object to handle the complete purchase lifecycle from checkout to fulfillment.

Use the `Order` object when you need to:

- Display order details on customer account pages or admin dashboards.
- Create orders for phone sales, wholesale customers, or subscription services.
- Update order information like shipping addresses, notes, or fulfillment status.
- Process returns, exchanges, and partial refunds.
- Generate invoices, receipts, and shipping labels.

The `Order` object serves as the central hub connecting customer information, product details, payment processing, and fulfillment data within the GraphQL Admin API schema.

> Note:
> Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older records,
> then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted
> access, then you can add the `read_all_orders`, `read_orders`, and `write_orders` scopes.

> Caution:
> Only use orders data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#requesting-specific-permissions) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

The `OrderTransaction` object represents a payment transaction that's associated with an order. An order
transaction is a specific action or event that happens within the context of an order, such as a customer paying
for a purchase or receiving a refund, or other payment-related activity.

Use the `OrderTransaction` object to capture the complete lifecycle of a payment, from initial
authorization to final settlement, including refunds and currency exchanges. Common use cases for using the
`OrderTransaction` object include:

- Processing new payments for orders
- Managing payment authorizations and captures
- Processing refunds for returned items
- Tracking payment status and errors
- Managing multi-currency transactions
- Handling payment gateway integrations

Each `OrderTransaction` object has a [`kind`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/OrderTransactionKind)
that defines the type of transaction and a [`status`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/OrderTransactionStatus)
that indicates the current state of the transaction. The object stores detailed information about payment
methods, gateway processing, and settlement details.

and [payment gateway integrations](https://www.shopify.com/ca/payment-gateways).

The `Product` object lets you manage products in a merchant’s store.

Products are the goods and services that merchants offer to customers. They can include various details such as title, description, price, images, and options such as size or color.
You can use [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/productvariant) to create or update different versions of the same product.
You can also add or update product [media](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/media).
Products can be organized by grouping them into a [collection](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/collection).

The `ProductVariant` object represents a version of a
[product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
that comes in more than one [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption),
such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options for size and color, then a small,
blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue t-shirt would be another.

Use the `ProductVariant` object to manage the full lifecycle and configuration of a product's variants. Common
use cases for using the `ProductVariant` object include:

- Tracking inventory for each variant
- Setting unique prices for each variant
- Assigning barcodes and SKUs to connect variants to fulfillment services
- Attaching variant-specific images and media
- Setting delivery and tax requirements
- Supporting product bundles, subscriptions, and selling plans

A `ProductVariant` is associated with a parent
[`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) object.
`ProductVariant` serves as the central link between a product's merchandising configuration, inventory,
pricing, fulfillment, and sales channels within the GraphQL Admin API schema. Each variant
can reference other GraphQL types such as:

- [`InventoryItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/InventoryItem): Used for inventory tracking
- [`Image`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Image): Used for variant-specific images
- [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup): Used for subscriptions and selling plans

  For example, an athletics store might create different collections for running attire, shoes, and accessories.
  
  Use the `collections` query when you need to:
  
  - Build a browsing interface for a store's product groupings.
  - Create collection searching, sorting, and filtering experiences (for example, by title, type, or published status).
  - Sync collection data with external systems.
  - Manage both custom ([manual](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection))
  and smart ([automated](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)) collections.
  
  The `collections` query supports [pagination](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/pagination-graphql)
  for large catalogs and [saved searches](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/collections#arguments-savedSearchId)
  for frequently used collection queries.
  
  The `collections` query returns collections with their associated metadata, including:
  
  - Basic collection information (title, description, handle, and type)
  - Collection image and SEO metadata
  - Product count and product relationships
  - Collection rules (for smart collections)
  - Publishing status and publication details
  - Metafields and custom attributes

  Use the `products` query when you need to:
  
  - Build a browsing interface for a product catalog.
  - Create product [searching](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/search-syntax), [sorting](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#arguments-sortKey), and [filtering](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#arguments-query) experiences.
  - Implement product recommendations.
  - Sync product data with external systems.
  
  The `products` query supports [pagination](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/pagination-graphql)
  to handle large product catalogs and [saved searches](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#arguments-savedSearchId)

  The `products` query returns products with their associated metadata, including:
  
  - Basic product information (for example, title, description, vendor, and type)
  - Product options and product variants, with their prices and inventory
  - Media attachments (for example, images and videos)
  - SEO metadata
  - Product categories and tags
  - Product availability and publishing statuses

The `Refund` object represents a financial record of money returned to a customer from an order.
It provides a comprehensive view of all refunded amounts, transactions, and restocking instructions
associated with returning products or correcting order issues.

The `Refund` object provides information to:

- Process customer returns and issue payments back to customers
- Handle partial or full refunds for line items with optional inventory restocking
- Refund shipping costs, duties, and additional fees
- Issue store credit refunds as an alternative to original payment method returns
- Track and reconcile all financial transactions related to refunds

Each `Refund` object maintains detailed records of what was refunded, how much was refunded,
which payment transactions were involved, and any inventory restocking that occurred. The refund
can include multiple components such as product line items, shipping charges, taxes, duties, and
additional fees, all calculated with proper currency handling for international orders.

Refunds are always associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
and can optionally be linked to a [return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return)
if the refund was initiated through the returns process. The refund tracks both the presentment currency
(what the customer sees) and the shop currency for accurate financial reporting.

> Note:
> The existence of a `Refund` object doesn't guarantee that the money has been returned to the customer.
> The actual financial processing happens through associated
> [`OrderTransaction`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction)
> objects, which can be in various states, such as pending, processing, success, or failure.
> To determine if money has actually been refunded, check the
> [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction#field-OrderTransaction.fields.status)
> of the associated transactions.

The `Return` object represents the intent of a buyer to ship one or more items from an order back to a merchant
or a third-party fulfillment location. A return is associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
and can include multiple return [line items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem).
Each return has a [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps#return-statuses),
which indicates the state of the return.

Use the `Return` object to capture the financial, logistical,
and business intent of a return. For example, you can identify eligible items for a return and issue customers
a refund for returned items on behalf of the merchant.

An individual sale record associated with a sales agreement. Every money value in an order's sales data is represented in the currency's smallest unit. When amounts are divided across multiple line items, such as taxes or order discounts, the amounts might not divide evenly across all of the line items on the order. To address this, the remaining currency units that couldn't be divided evenly are allocated one at a time, starting with the first line item, until they are all accounted for. In aggregate, the values sum up correctly. In isolation, one line item might have a different tax or discount amount than another line item of the same price, before taxes and discounts. This is because the amount could not be divided evenly across the items. The allocation of currency units across line items is immutable. After they are allocated, currency units are never reallocated or redistributed among the line items.

A subscription contract that defines recurring purchases for a customer. Each contract specifies what products to deliver, when to bill and ship them, and at what price.

The contract includes [`SubscriptionBillingPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionBillingPolicy) and [`SubscriptionDeliveryPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionDeliveryPolicy) that control the frequency of charges and fulfillments. [`SubscriptionLine`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionLine) items define the products, quantities, and pricing for each recurring [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). The contract tracks [`SubscriptionBillingAttempt`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionBillingAttempt) records, payment status, and generated orders throughout its lifecycle. [`App`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/App) instances manage contracts through various status transitions including active, paused, failed, cancelled, or expired states.

The `SubscriptionDraft` object represents a draft version of a
[subscription contract](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract)
before it's committed. It serves as a staging area for making changes to an existing subscription or creating
a new one. The draft allows you to preview and modify various aspects of a subscription before applying the changes.

Use the `SubscriptionDraft` object to:

- Add, remove, or modify subscription lines and their quantities
- Manage discounts (add, remove, or update manual and code-based discounts)
- Configure delivery options and shipping methods
- Set up billing and delivery policies
- Manage customer payment methods
- Add custom attributes and notes to generated orders
- Configure billing cycles and next billing dates
- Preview the projected state of the subscription

Each `SubscriptionDraft` object maintains a projected state that shows how the subscription will look after the changes
are committed. This allows you to preview the impact of your modifications before applying them. The draft can be
associated with an existing subscription contract (for modifications) or used to create a new subscription.

The draft remains in a draft state until it's committed, at which point the changes are applied to the subscription
contract and the draft is no longer accessible.

Connects your app to Amazon EventBridge so you can receive Shopify webhook events and process them through AWS's event-driven architecture. This gives you enterprise-grade scalability and lets you tap into the full AWS ecosystem for handling webhook traffic.

For example, when a customer places an order, Shopify can publish the order creation event directly to your EventBridge partner source, allowing your AWS infrastructure to process the event through Lambda functions, SQS queues, or other AWS services.

EventBridge endpoints provide enterprise-grade event routing and processing capabilities, making them ideal for apps that need to handle high-volume webhook traffic or integrate deeply with AWS services.

An HTTPS endpoint that receives webhook events as POST requests, letting your app respond to Shopify events in real-time. This is the most common webhook endpoint type, allowing apps to process Shopify events through standard HTTP callbacks.

HTTP endpoints offer straightforward webhook integration with immediate event delivery, making them suitable for apps that need real-time notifications without complex infrastructure requirements.

Webhook subscriptions let you receive instant notifications when important events happen in a merchant's store, so you can automate workflows and keep your systems in sync without constantly polling for updates.

For example, a subscription might monitor `orders/create` events and send JSON payloads to `https://yourapp.com/webhooks/orders` whenever customers place new orders, enabling immediate order processing workflows.

Use the `WebhookSubscription` object to:
- Monitor active webhook configurations
- Access subscription details like topics, endpoints, and filtering rules
- Retrieve creation and update timestamps for audit purposes
- Review API versions and format settings
- Examine metafield namespace configurations for extended data access

Each subscription includes comprehensive configuration details such as the specific Shopify events being monitored, the destination endpoint (HTTP, EventBridge, or Pub/Sub), event filtering criteria, and payload customization settings. The subscription tracks its creation and modification history.

Subscriptions can include advanced features like Shopify search syntax for event filtering to control
which events trigger notifications, specific field inclusion rules to control which fields are included
in the webhook payload, and metafield namespace access to capture custom store data. The API version
is inherited from the app that created the webhook subscription.

The endpoint configuration varies by type - HTTP subscriptions include callback URLs, EventBridge subscriptions reference AWS ARNs, and Pub/Sub subscriptions specify Google Cloud project and topic details. This flexibility allows apps to integrate webhooks with their preferred infrastructure and event processing systems.
